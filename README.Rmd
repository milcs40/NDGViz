# NDGViz

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of NDGViz is to showcase how we can build R packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NDGViz from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("milcs40/NDGViz")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of what the package can do right now, which is not much.

```{r example}
library(NDGViz)

is_odd(1)
is_odd(2)
```
